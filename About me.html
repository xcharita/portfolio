    About Me
</h1>

<p>
    I have lived in the United States of America for 20 years and originally i am from The Netherlands. In that country it is most of the time cold and the weather can be sometimes really excruciating!! Especially during winters! There are 4 seasons to be enjoyed and the clouds seems to be changing all the time. Reason for writing about them...

   I knew Udacity before but was never ready to actually start a Nano degree and give that commitment until i saw the Web Technology Curriculum and the possibility to grow on your own pace. The study has given me good insights and i am looking forward to learn more.

    I am planning to make this site with every next project more advanced for a portfolio which will land me a job position ultimately.
